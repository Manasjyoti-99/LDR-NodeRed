# LDR-NodeRed
A LDR circuit to display the value of resistance based on the intensity of incident light is created using ldr and esp8266 in Node MCU, written in Arduino C language. The circuit gathers data from the environment and publishes it to the Node Red Dashboard through a HiveMQ MQTT Broker server.
